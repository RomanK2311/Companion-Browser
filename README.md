# Companion Browser
Lightweight and good looking simple browser to be used along side a more sophisticated browser (hence the name), at the moment preferably a Chromium based browser, e.g. [Google Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome), [Brave Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser), [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/), [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser)...

Most features work without another browser of course!
